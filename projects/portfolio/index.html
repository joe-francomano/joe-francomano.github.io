                        <p>Hello everybody! My name is Joe Francomano and I am currently a Third-Year Journalism Major
                            at The University of Maryland, College Park. Along with my journalism major, I am also
                            pursuing a General Business Minor as well. One day, I hope to work in the production side of
                            a sports televesion broadcast, whether that is the live broadcast of a game, or the
                            broadcast of a sports television show, like Sportscenter. All my life I have been a die hard
                            sports fan. From playing mostly every sport you can think of when I was a child, to staying
                            up late watching the big game, sports has always been a major part of my life. That's why
                            when it was time for me to decide what I wanted to do with my futre, I knew sports
                            television was the right answer for me! I grew up in Rockland County in a small suburb about
                            30 minutes north of New York City. I have two little sisters, ages 15 and 18, and the cutest
                            dog in the world, Kemba!</p>

                        <p>This video is from my News Videographgy class during my second semester sophomore year. Our
                            task was to cover a table or event from "Maryland Day" by shooting interviews and scene
                            setter clips of the event to produce a news story. "Maryland Day" is a University open house
                            where all clubs and organizations from the University host engangement events all across
                            campus to Maryland commuity members. I enjoyed doing this project and loved learing about
                            the University of Maryland's GLobal Stewards Program!</p>
